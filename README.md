# GroceryInventoryApp

You know how you go to the grocery store, you see soap, and you wonder if you need soap or if you have a full bottle of it under your sink at home? 

Also, your shopping list says to get ketchup, so you go to the left side of the store to get ketchup. Next item is bananas, so you go to the right side of the store to get bananas. Next item is milk, which is on the left side of the store and you think "Golly! If I knew I'd be getting milk I would have picked it up after the ketchup!"

This app is intended to be a much more efficient alternative to using a simple shopping list when shopping for groceries. This current version has you take inventory before you shop and assumes you go to the same store every time. (Best used on iPhone Plus sizes but should work on others)

# How to use:
1. Divide your inventory page into sections around the house (fridge, freezer, bathroom,etc) be as specific or broad as you'd like. 
2. Divide your store into sections (product section, back left corner, aisle 1, etc.) be as specific or broad as you'd like. [NOTE: store sections are saving even though they don't appear at first]
3. On your inventory page, build your list of products that you may need from the grocery store and assign each product a home section and a store section. (if you make a mistake tap on the edit button)
4. Time to take inventory! On the inventory page tap on a product to indicate how many of that product you'll need to buy.
5. Go shopping! Now only the needed products and their sections appear on the shopping page! As you pick up each product, tap on it to reduce the amount needed.
6. Go do something awesome with your extra time!
